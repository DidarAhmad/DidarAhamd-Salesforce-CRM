Salesforce Project Automation System

This project demonstrates a real-world Salesforce automation workflow built in a Trailhead Playground environment. The goal was to simulate how companies design custom CRM modules and automate business logic using Salesforce Flow Builder.

📌 Project Overview

A custom Project Management module was created to track company projects, budgets, and status. Automation ensures that high-budget projects are automatically activated based on predefined business rules.

This mirrors how organizations enforce operational policies inside Salesforce.

🧱 Features Implemented

Custom Object: Project

Custom Fields:

Budget (Currency)

Start Date (Date)

Status (Picklist)

Record-triggered Flow Automation

Business Rule Enforcement

Real-time status updates

Sample project records for testing

⚙️ Automation Logic

Business rule implemented:

If Project Budget > 10,000
→ Automatically set Status = Active

This was achieved using a Record-Triggered Flow.

The automation runs whenever a project record is created or updated.
